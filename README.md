![Vortex Combat Gameplay](../assests/forReadMe/vsScreen.png)

Vortex Combat features a classic best-of-one round system. Each fighter has a health bar and stamina meter. Perform attacks to deplete your opponent's health, while managing your own stamina.

Fighters can move left and right, jump, guard, and perform quick or strong attacks. Time your attacks carefully, as missed attacks will leave you open!

The game features a dynamic camera that zooms and pans to keep the action in view. Particle effects and screen shakes add impact to hits. The stages are interactive, with unique hazards and dynamic lighting.

## üé® Fighters

Vortex Combat launches with two unique fighters:

- **Curse-Or**: A nimble martial artist with fast strikes and aerial attacks. His special move is the Shadow Shift, allowing him to teleport behind opponents.
- **Reign**: A heavy bruiser with powerful punches and kicks. 

Each fighter has over 30 unique sprites for idle, moving, jumping, attacking, blocking, getting hit, and more. Smooth animation transitions make the fighters come alive.

## üó∫Ô∏è Stages

Vortex Combat features 4 unique stages, each with their own theme, hazards, and background animation:

- **Temple**: A serene temple in the mountains. Cherry blossoms drift in the wind, while stone lanterns illuminate the battlefield.
- **Palace**: A haunted palace courtyard under a full moon. Ghosts and spirits can be seen in the windows.
- **The Pit**: A gritty back-alley in Chinatown. Neon signs flicker and rats scurry in the gutters.  
- **Dead Pool**: An ancient stone bridge over a misty chasm. Skeletal hands reach up from the depths.

Vortex Combat was developed in just 2 weeks by the two-person team of Shalin and Ashim. Their goal was to create an authentic arcade fighting game experience using only vanilla web technologies.

The game is built with:

- **HTML** for structure and UI
- **CSS** for presentation, animations, and effects 
- **JavaScript** for all game logic, physics, rendering and interactivity

By focusing on pure JavaScript, the developers were able to deepen their understanding of the language fundamentals and push the boundaries of what's possible in the browser, without relying on frameworks or libraries.

Some of the key technical challenges they overcame included:

- Implementing a custom 2D Fights withought implimenting Physics
- Syncing audio with gameplay events 
- Making the UI very drnatic and user's attention grasping.

Through clever use of object-oriented programming, asynchronous scripting, and hardware-accelerated CSS, they were able to deliver a polished, feature-rich game in a short timeframe.
